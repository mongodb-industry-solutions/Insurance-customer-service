# Insurance-customer-service

The demo showcases howMongoDB can revolutionize call center operations for insurance companies by converting call recordings into searchable vectors. This transformation allows agents to quickly access relevant information, improving customer service and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Where MongoDB Shines?

MongoDB shines in this solution by providing a robust platform for storing and querying vectorized data through MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. Its flexibility and scalability enable real-time data access and integration with AI-driven applications, facilitating efficient and accurate information retrieval for customer service enhancements.

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) for the Frontend
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the Backend
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for the database
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for styling


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js 14 or higher
- Python 3.9 or higher

## Run it locally

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Create a `.env`file:
```
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8000/TranscribeStreaming
REACT_APP_TEXT_SEARCH_URL=http://localhost:8000/textSearch
```
3. Install dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the frontend development server with:
````bash
npm run dev
````
4. The frontend will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default, providing a user interface.

### Backend 

1. Navigate to the `backed` folder.
2. Create a `.env`file:
```
MONGO_URI=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_KEY_REGION=
```
4. Install dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the backend development server with:
````bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
````
4. The backend will now be accessible at http://localhost:8000 by default.

## Run with Docker

Make sure to run this on the root directory.

1. To run with Docker use the following command:
```
make build
```
2. To delete the container and image run:
```
make clean
```

## Common errors

- Check that you've created an `.env` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys, environment and index variables.
